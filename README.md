# slimeSim
Heavily inspired by and building on Sebastian Lague's Slime Simulator.
Found here: https://github.com/SebLague/Slime-Simulation

Expanded functionality mainly covers being able to spawn food by interacting with the screen as well as being able to upload various "metro maps" in order to see how the slime mold would compare to various metro systems.
